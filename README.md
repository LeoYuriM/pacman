# Pacman

A Pacman game on Pycharm

The file pacman.py is a simple yellow circle bouncing in the screen, it's the first version, just to understand the basics.

The file pacman2.py is the actual game, with the maze, ghosts - Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan), and Clyde (orange), 5 lifes and the score. Have fun!

The file pacmanmouse.py is just an example of moving the character with the Mouse.
